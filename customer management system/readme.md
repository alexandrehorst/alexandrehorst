# Office patient registration program:
# This program is based on list manipulation (called cad) that is composed of several sublists, which contain the information of each patient.
# The list can be loaded from an excel sheet (now) or a database (SQL database in the future roadmap).
# The patient data sublists are basically organized by: name, telephone, Address, CPF, profession, e-mail, next appointment day, # next appointment time,
